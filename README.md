# To-Do List

A to-do list made with HTML, CSS and Express.js. I made this list to experiment and learn about EJS - templates and layouts, and how node modules work.

## How to run in your local server
Clone this repository and save it locally. 
Go to your terminal and give the command
```
npm init node
```

This initializes node for you. After that, we will install the packages needed and used for this project.
```
npm i express body-parser
```

To run the local server, we give the command
```
node app.js
```
Or wherever your main JS server code resides. 

This is what the site should look like when you run it on the home route on your browser by entering `localhost:3000`.
